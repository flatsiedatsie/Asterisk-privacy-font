# Asterisk-privacy-font
A font where every letter is a circle. Use it to hide sensitive information in interfaces by simply changing the font of the text. It's available here as OFT and SVG font file.

I consider it to be in the public domain.

You can edit and expand the font by using Glyphr Studio, an online font creation tool. Open the project file at:
